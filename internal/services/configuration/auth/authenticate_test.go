// TestAuthenticateWithOCI_MockedService tests the AuthenticateWithOCI function with a mocked service
func TestAuthenticateWithOCI_MockedService(t *testing.T) {
	// Skip this test in normal test runs since it requires mocking several functions
	// that are not designed for testing
	t.Skip("Skipping test that requires extensive mocking")

	// In a real test environment, we would need to:
	// 1. Create a mock for the NewService function
	// 2. Create a mock for performInteractiveAuthentication method
	// 3. Create a mock for PrintExportVariable function
	// 4. Create a mock for the util.PromptYesNo function
	// 5. Create a mock for the runOCIAuthRefresher method
	//
	// This is challenging because these functions are not designed for testing,
	// and Go doesn't have built-in support for mocking like some other languages.
	//
	// A better approach would be to refactor the code to make it more testable,
	// for example, by injecting dependencies rather than creating them inside the function.
